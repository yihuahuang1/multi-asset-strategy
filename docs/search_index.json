Such signals or indicators help the traders and PMs becoming more informed and aware of the current market performance/conditions. 翻译 There are two major approaches to classify the indicators or to analyze any asset, i.e. technical analysis &amp; fundamental analysis: Fundamental analysis focuses on the performance of an asset by studying various factors/indicators, which may impact the asset price, such as the company’s earnings, its cash flow statement and balance sheet, operating efficiency, corporate governance, sector outlook, macro trend, and etc. Unlike the income statement modeling and industry/sector research conducted by the fundamental analysis, technical analysis aims to predict the future movements(patterns and trends) of certain indicators of an asset (mostly price and volume related); based soley on the historical/past characteristics of various technical indicators, which are (typically) displayed graphically in charts. 翻译 The core assumptions behind these two major methods are that: The fundamental analysis approach uses information (directly or indirectly) related to the asset itself (e.g EBITDA of the firm), and assumes those information were already factored into the market price fluctuations in time (the EMH). By identifying the historical patterns of these indicators or factors, and assuming they provide sufficient information in predicting the (future) trend, one can predict such indicator for the near future (e.g FY26E $EPS). Further, utilizing modern finance models like the CAPM and the multi-factor models with Machine Learning, future asset price movements can be predicted with more confidence (however, not necessarily accuracy). the assumptions for the technical analysis approach are much simpler. One believes that the historical up/down trend of a technical indicator will continue on that path or the path will reverse in the near-term future. In other words, technical indicators like price and trading volume, are assumed to move in trends or counter trends, which are repetitive, with certain patterns reoccurring, i.e. History will repeat itself (Example: momentum trading strategy and mean reversion strategy). 翻译 With the research goal in building a portfolio with maximum long-term risk-adjusted returns while controlling the maximum drawdown, we certainly need to invest in a pool stocks with the largest winning probability in gaining positive investment returns and with the least amount of volatility. By acknowledging the usefulness and limitations of fundamental and technical analysis, we can design a quantitative model based on these analytically methodologies to build a portfolio which best suit our preset investment goals and risk preferences. 翻译 Table 2.1: EMA Trading Signals (TSLA.US) a b c 成交量类因子 (Volume Factor) Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator (ADOSC); Chaikin Money Flow (CMF); Price Volume Trend (PVT); On-Balance Volume (OBV); Archer On-Balance Volume (AOBV); Elder’s Force Index (EFI); Ease of Movement (EOM); Money Flow Index (MFI); Positive Volume Index (PVI); Negative Volume Index (NVI); Price-Volume (PVOL); Price Volume Rank (PVR); Volume Profile (VP); etc. 动量类因子 (Momentum Factor) Rate of Change (ROC); Awesome Oscillator (AO); Absolute Price Oscillator (APO); Bias (BIAS); Balance of Power (BOP); Commodity Channel Index (CCI); Chanda Forecast Oscillator (CFO); Center of Gravity (CG); Correlation Trend Indicator (CTI); Efficiency Ratio (ER); Elder Ray Index (ERI); Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD); Stochastic Oscillator (KDJ); Inertia; Relative Strength Index (RSI); Relative Strength Xtra (RSX); n-day Momentum (MOM); Psychological Line (PSL); Slope; Stochastic Momentum Index Ergodic Indicator (SMI Ergodic Indicator); Squeeze (SQZ); Squeeze Pro (SQZPRO); Stochastic Relative Strength Index (STOCHRSI); Triple Exponentially Smoothed Moving Average (TRIX); True Strength Index (TSI); etc. 趋势类因子 (Trend Factor) Average Directional Movement Index (ADX); Archer Moving Averages Trends (AMAT); Choppiness Index (CHOP); Decay; Increasing/Decreasing; Detrend Price Oscillator (DPO); Long run/Short run; Q Stick (qstick); TTM Trend; Vortex (Vortex Indicator); and etc. 波动性类因子 (Volatility Factor) Historical Volatility (HV); Implied Volatility (IV); beta (\\(\\beta\\)); Aberration; True Range (TR); Average True Range (ATR); Bollinger Bands (BBands); Mass Index (massi); Relative Volatility Index (RVI); Acceleration Bands (accbands); Elder’s Thermometer (thermos); Ulcer Index (ui); etc. Fundamental Indicators (基本面指标) 基本面类因子 (经营效率，盈利能力，成长性和估值，现金流，财务质量) (Fundamental Factor) Asset Turnover Ratio (ATR); Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR); Account Receivable Turnover Ratio (ARTR); Long-term Asset Turnover Ratio (LATR), Short-term (Operating) Asset Turnover Ratio (SATR); EV/EBITDA; EV/Sales; Free Cash Flow Yield (FCF Yield); Price/Earnings Ratio (PE); Price/Book Ratio (PB); Price/Sales (PS); Return on Assets (ROA); Return on Equity (ROE); Return on Invested Capital (ROIC); Dividend Yield; Gross Margin Ratio (GMR); Operating Profit Margin Ratio (OMR); Net Profit/EBIT Margin Ratio (NPR); EBITDA Margin Ratio; Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC); Economic Profit (ROIC-WACC); and etc. 风格因子 (Other Style Factor) Size; Dividend; Sentiment; etc. Portfolio Indicators (组合类指标) 投资策略因子 (Strategy &amp; Portfolio Factor) Information Ratio; Maximum Drawdown (MDD); etc. Note: Output 2.3.2.b: Last 8 rows are shown. 1 Includes tsignal4, tsignal5, tsignal6, tsignal6a and tsignal6b. 2.3 Considerations on Model Designs 模型设计的思考 In achieving the ultimate investment goal of building a ‘high-return and low-risk’ stock-only portfolio, we are aiming to build a quantitative model with the most effective components. There are countless relative metrics and factors evaluating an asset or a firm, whether the particular indicator/factor is significant to the price movements is a question in much more depth. 翻译 To have ‘meaningful’ model components, we will divide and concur the research objectives by first selecting stocks with near-term investment opportunities (the base model). Following, we will then filter the selected list of stock more rigorously so the positive investment return are more ‘certain’ for the longer-term with minimal downside risk (the full model). In other words, the base model will input the significant technical indicators to select a list of ‘possible winning’ U.S stocks (with potential investment opportunities). Following, the complete model (Section 5) will include the significant fundamental indicators/factors to further filter from the list of selected stocks, and keep the ones with ‘higher certainty’ of long-term risk-adjusted (investment) returns. 翻译 Besides selecting stocks based on appropriate and significant indicators/factors with the greatest investment return potentials, the model will also include subjective filters to suit specific investment needs/goals (example: able to buy and hold, hot areas of investment interest), risk preferences, and compliance requirements (example: invest in market cap \\(&gt;\\$7B\\))。 翻译 过滤条件是主观设定的，同时可以根据其他投资需求与风险偏好进行筛选。 A technical indicator is basically a mathematical representation and manipulation of the basic raw trading data and statistics of an asset (e.g. adj close price, trading volume, 52-week high and low, etc.). In other words, a technical indicator is usually a derivation of the raw trading statistics and is designed to represent/signal certain market behavior. Traders typically view the technical indicators as tools on a trading chart to analyze the market trend in a clearer manner. In trading, a technical indicator is like a financial compass, which provides certain market behavior insights (overbought, oversold, potential reversal, range-bound, etc), so investment opportunities and risks can be identified more clearly and intuitively. Traders and PMs can utilize a combination of technical indicators to make informed real-time trading decisions with more confidence. here One of the ultimate goals in any type of security analysis is to understand/predict the ‘direction’ of the asset’s future price movements. There are various technical indicators that traders use to predict/deduce future price levels (Section 2.2). One of the common technical trading strategies is momentum trading, which is also the core assumptions we made in building the stock selection model. A stock that has been rising is said to have positive momentum while a stock that has been crashing is said to have negative momentum. Momentum is an investing factor that aims to benefit from the ongoing trend of a stock or asset. Momentum trading centers on buying and selling assets following their recent performance trends. Traders using this strategy believe that assets moving strongly in a direction will continue to do so. They aim to capitalize on this momentum before it fades. *Trend followers believe that stocks moving up or down will continue on that path. In contrast, mean reversion suggests that assets overreact and will eventually return to their mean values.Momentum trading thrives in markets exhibiting strong trends. It’s less effective in sideways or highly volatile markets. Therefore, identifying the right market conditions is critical for success. Sudden market reversals can quickly erode gains. Hence, effective risk management is essential. Technical Indicators do not follow a general pattern, meaning, they behave differently with every security. What can be a good indicator for a particular security, might not hold the case for the other. Thus, using a technical indicator requires jurisprudence coupled with good experience. "],["base-model-construction-基础模型搭建.html", "Chapter 3 (Base) Model Construction 基础模型搭建 3.1 Intro on (Base) Model Design and Construction 模型设计搭建概要 3.2 Portfolio-specific Subjective Indicators 其他组合相关过滤指标", " Chapter 3 (Base) Model Construction 基础模型搭建 3.1 Intro on (Base) Model Design and Construction 模型设计搭建概要 The model designing to select stocks is heavily dependent on the portfolio strategy and risk preferences. To reiterate, the base model will select stocks signaling near-term investment opportunities based on a combination of technical indicators. Over 6,000 stocks currently listed in the U.S. security market, however, some may not be appropriate for the portfolio (style, risk, compliance, etc.). For instance, a stock went public one year ago with a market cap of $10B does not satisfy the investment style and risk reference. To save computing power, the model will subjectively filter out these ‘inappropriate’ stocks in advance to any machine selection processes based on indication signals. 翻译 More specifically: Step 1: Fetch market data: The model will gather up-to-date raw trading data and statistics (open, close, volume etc.) for stocks currently listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ (U.S. stocks listed on the following exchanges: PHLX, MS4X, BSE, CHX, and NSX are excluded in this study). 翻译 Step 2: Drop ‘nonviable’ stocks (Portfolio-specific Filters): First, the subjective filters eliminate the ‘inappropriate’ stocks, which are the ones will not be considered as a viable investment option; because of the unmatched management styles, internal risk management guidelines, risk preference, investor/client investment preferences/risk tolerance, etc. (subjective: the eliminated securities are due to subjective preset investment goals, management styles or risk management guidelines; but may be stocks could bring substantial future returns). 翻译 Step 3: Calculate the indicators (Technical Indicators Construction): There are countless of technical indicators, and we will first pick a pool of indicators we deem fit in characterizing the U.S equity price performances. Following, with a programmatic approach, the model computes the indicator value(s), and produces any meaningful graphs. In terms of trading signals, we will set conventional signal parameters, where further investment-specific setting adjustments may become necessary. Moreover, we will use a handful of widely-traded stocks to test whether the program for each technical indicators perform by providing trading signals as intended (not a test on signal accuracy). 翻译 Step 4: Select a combination of significant technical indicators (Technical Indicator Effectiveness Ranking) The characteristics and preset assumptions of the technical indicators, meaning they behave differently for each market with every security. For instance, one can be an effective indicator in terms of signaling accuracy for a stock in a more traded sector, may not hold the case for another stock which is less liquid. Similar applies to the indicator parameters, where different parameter settings may lead to opposite trading signals during different periods. Whether the following indicators are effective and accurate is questionable. Thus, the model utilizes a ranking system to objectively determine their effectiveness, i.e. significant indicators. Using technical indicators in reaching a profitable trading decision requires jurisprudence coupled with investment experience. The model methodology is to use the full dataset with all 5,400+ stocks currently listed on NYSE and NASDAQ, to test and rank the technical indicators in terms of the accuracy in giving the correct trading signals (1,997 NYSE, 3,433 NASDAQ as of Feb 22, 2024). For example, say the RSI accuracy is 70% and No.1 among all technical indicators, by giving the correct next-day trading signals for 3,780+ stocks week-long; which its signal accuracy is higher than any other indicators. With a programmatic approach, the effectiveness evaluation processes produce an accuracy-based ranking for all input technical indicators. 翻译 However, using a technical-only based model emerges a practical and tricky issue, where one significant indicator may disagree with another significant indicator on trading signals. A subjective set of indicator parameters may also cause similar mixed-signal issues. In practice, analysts and PMs reference a combination of the technical indicators, along with other security analysis methods (fundamental, quant, etc.) before arriving at a trading decision (Buy/Sell/Hold). Moreover, investment strategies usually vary for different fund products. To have the stock selection model becoming more adaptive and customizable for various investment needs; for example, to be able to output two separate top-30 stock lists for a buy-and-hold strategy and a long-short risk-neutral strategy. Therefore, the model not only need to be adaptive to input different sets of significant technical indicators (example: 2 sets of technical indicators to signal for shorter-and-longer-term returns), but also for numerous combinations of parameter settings. 翻译 More specifically (for Step 4), the model first utilizes the full (U.S. stock) dataset to test and rank the effectiveness of all input technical indicators, and produces two combinations of significant technical indicators, one set for shorter-term (intraday, next day) signals and one set for longer-term signals. Regarding the parameter settings for the technical indicators, the process in determining the ‘best’ setting is relatively subjective. It requires manual adjustments for each (of them who needs a parameter input), in which different settings at different sample (testing) periods may result differently. Most importantly, trading signals directly influenced by the parameter settings; and the investment styles/goals also have direct impact on the settings (e.g. an aggressive strategy, a trend-following strategy, and an EIF strategy certainly requires different parameter settings, and similar applies to initiate trades on the left or right). 翻译 Step 5: Stock Selection &amp; Trading Signals – the Base Model By finishing the process of datasets inputs, and the elimination of stocks on portfolio-specific (‘nonviable’) filters, the (base) stock selection model can now fetch the up-to-date stock trading statistics through the chosen combinations of significant technical indicators. By design, every technical indicator generates a trading signal based on the given parameter settings for each stock. Following, the model counts the number of trading signals generated for each stock. An aggregate signaling rule needs to be established in advance for the model to generate the trading recommendation, however, this setting can be modified easily to suit specific investment needs and the continuously changing market landscape. 翻译 For example, the PMs can set the rule with a (theoretical) winning-probability threshold of 75%, and say from the model output, stock A generated 11 short position signals from a total of 14 significant technical indicators, which \\(\\frac{11}{14}&gt;75\\%\\). The stock-selection model which indicated that stock A has a(n) aggregate SELL signal as of today. Obviously, with the subjective setting of the winning probability threshold, the programming approach of the model can automate the tedious and heavy computing process, and produces a list of BUY stocks, and a list of SELL stocks. Furthermore, to suit various investment goals/needs like multiple strategies for different portfolios; the model input can easily be modified into two combinations of technical indicators. As an example, besides generating trading recommendations (BUY/SELL/HOLD) for each stock, the model can further indicate/signal whether which stocks have the investment potential (either direction) for a longer-term (Note: such additional recommendation may be due to the extra combination of technical indicators and/or different indicator settings). Above summarized the complete processes in detail, to construct an adaptative U.S. stock selection model using only technical indicators (i.e. the base model) and to generate trading recommendations accordingly. 翻译 Note: We believe technical indicators are relatively objective as they are derivations of market data and statistics. Therefore, by theory, such model should include the less randomness and bias in trading recommendations. To control portfolio drawdowns, while seeking for higher risk-adjusted returns, we purposely divide the model into two parts and introduce model factors/indicators stepwise. Other types of analytical data and statistics include somewhat subjectivity, however, the complete stock selection model (i.e. the full model) (Section 5) will accept significant fundamental, growth/value, volatility, and emotion factors. 翻译 Step 6: Base Model Back-test and RM Additions (Portfolio Simulation [Setting: Base Model, Allocation: Equal Weight]) After gathered the recommended list of stocks to invest generated by the base model, the program is set to evaluate the model performance. A standard back-test is then performed, in which the portfolio is constituted by the model-selected U.S. stocks. Trades are set to execute in accordance with the model-generated trading signals (BUY/SELL/HOLD), and the set theoretical winning-probability threshold (the aggregate signaling rule). For the simplicity and the purpose in controlling variables, the asset allocation rule for this simulated portfolio is set to be equal weight. Finally, the program computes the investment return of the simulated portfolio in percentages. In constructing a model to select U.S. equities, and assess the strategy performance, we assumed a stock-only portfolio. In practice, we need to consider the risk exposure. Effective and proactice risk management is essential for a stock-heavy portfolio. For instance, depends on the overall volatility from the selected stocks, the PMs can invest in ETFs or appropriate commodities or keep a higher cash or cash equivalent asset to hedge. 翻译 &lt;insert.png&gt; [model design flow chart] Above has explained in great details about the expectations of the price volume strategy, the philosophy in designing the stock selection model and the necessary steps in constructing such model with a programming approach. A ‘technical-only’ quantitative model is rare today, and without much reference to follow, subjective and fundamental factors are usually included in constructing such portfolio. Therefore, the report has exhibited the assumptions, subjective decisions, and all influential elements for the designing and modeling processes in detail.

The following in \\(\\S 2.3\\) exhibits the computation results, graphs/charts, and generated trading signals based on subjectively set parameters for each of the 12 technical indicators. Whether one tech indicator is effective is evaluated in \\(\\S 2.4\\). Model simulation for a portfolio constructed of the selected stocks will be performed and analyzed in \\(\\S 3.1\\). Note: For all technical indicators utilized for this stock selection strategy, only the traditional (type of) technical analysis was applied; and there were no Machine Learning or AI enhanced directly for any indicators, nor any ML-driven evaluation processes included in selecting the significant indicators (in \\(\\S 2.4\\)). For example: the RSI is the one of the most widely used trading indicators to detect potential oversold and overbought signals. As one of the classical trading tools, RSI has its defects. RSI tends of under or over react in sudden market shifts. Nowadays, quant analysts and traders often utilizes the LSTM (Long short-term memory) framework, one of the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) Deep Learning Models to enhance the RSI performance, and applies Bayesian Optimization on the parameter settings. 翻译. Starting at over 5,600+ stocks listed on NYSE and NASDAQ, and with eliminations by the subjective indicators, about xx U.S. stocks are input for technical indicators to filter and further model processes. In general, the program is set to perform computations and generate tradings signals accordingly for each input stock; without occupying the majority of report spaces, all outputs (computation summaries/tables, charts/graphs) are therefore suppressed (A warning like below is provided for each suppressed output). For each model step, the report only shows the program output for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA.US); the same applies for the remaining of the report. Analysts may construct a web ui database program, so the PMs and analysts are able to check the indicator valuations, and their graphs or charts for the most up-to-date selection of stocks. &lt;Insert a chart with all indicators (sig or not sig) and character them as type of indicators mom volume etc&gt; 翻译. 4.1 Technical Indicator 1: Simple Moving Avaerage (SMA) (Includes tsignal1, tsignal2, and tsignal3) 翻译 Intro- SMA: Commonly, traders intend to observe the average stock prices of the last number of trading days, is often defined as the moving average price or the rolling average price. An n-day simple moving average price, or the n-day SMA price, which refers to the arithmetic average or the simple average of the stock prices (the model uses the adjusted close prices) for the past n consecutive trading days. The SMA lines tend to smooth out volatility or price variations, and makes the visualization of price trends more clear and intuitive. Mathematically defined as: \\[\\text{SMA}_t=\\frac{P_t+...+P_{t-n+1}}{n}=\\frac{\\sum^{t}_{i=t-n+1}P_i}{n}\\] The program uses the formula shown above to compute the simple moving average (SMA) values for all stocks in the model at various parameter settings, and creates appropriate related visualizations. Following, the SMA trading signals will be constructed. 翻译 Table 4.1: SMA Computations (TSLA.US) Symbol Date Adj Close SM5 SMA8 SMA13 SMA20 SMA50 SMA200 Volume TSLA 2024-02-09 193.6 187.4 187.6 189.0 197.7 225.6 232.6 84,476,300 TSLA 2024-02-12 188.1 188.8 187.7 187.5 196.1 224.5 232.8 95,498,600 TSLA 2024-02-13 184.0 188.6 187.1 187.6 194.3 223.3 232.9 86,759,500 TSLA 2024-02-14 188.7 188.8 187.2 188.0 193.0 222.3 233.0 81,203,000 TSLA 2024-02-15 200.4 191.0 189.6 188.8 192.4 221.6 233.2 120,831,800 TSLA 2024-02-16 199.9 192.3 191.5 189.4 191.8 220.9 233.4 111,173,600 TSLA 2024-02-20 193.8 193.4 192.3 189.9 191.1 220.0 233.6 104,545,800 TSLA 2024-02-21 194.8 195.5 192.9 190.4 190.3 219.0 233.7 103,844,000 TSLA 2024-02-22 197.4 197.3 193.4 191.1 189.8 218.1 233.9 92,739,500 TSLA 2024-02-23 192.0 195.6 193.9 191.9 190.3 217.1 234.0 78,670,300 Note: Output 2.3.1.a: Last 10 rows are shown.

As an illustration, above table shows the computed SMA values (shown above) and line charts (shown below) for TSLA.US. 翻译 Trading signal(s) &amp; strategies- SMA: Normally, when a short-run SMA crosses from below to above a longer-run SMA is an indication to BUY. When a short-run SMA crosses from above to below a longer-run SMA is an indication to SELL. SMA Trading Signal #1: \\(\\text{close price}&gt;\\text{SMA}(20)\\) (Price relative to SMA) [tsignal1] When the most recent closing price (the model uses the adjusted close prices) is above its SMA20 indicates a BUY signal, and vice versa for a SELL signal. We consider when \\(\\text{close price}&gt;\\text{SMA}(20)\\), the stock is trading at a strength relative to its recent (over a month) price history. SMA Trading Signal #2: \\(\\text{SMA}(50)&gt;\\text{SMA}(200)\\) (Hierarchical Moving Average Alignment) [tsignal2] Above mathematical expression is not completely accurate, where we believe when SMA50 crosses from below to above a 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA200) indicates the stock prices are stable and established an uptrend trend, i.e. a BUY signal, and vice versa. When the SMA50 crosses from above to below a SMA200 indicates a SELL signal. Note, this is one of the most classical SMA trading strategies, commonly refers to as the ‘golden cross’ and ‘death cross’. SMA Trading Signal #3: \\(\\text{SMA}(8)&gt;\\text{SMA}(13)\\) &amp; \\(\\text{SMA}(5)&gt;\\text{SMA}(8)\\) [tsignal3] Above mathematical expression is not completely accurate either, where we believe when SMA8 crosses from below to above a 13-day Simple Moving Average (SMA13) indicates the stock prices are in an upward trend for the medium term. If concurrently, the SMA5 crosses from below to above a SMA8, which indicates the stock prices are in an upward trend for the short-to-medium term; a BUY opportunity is signaled. On the contrast, when the SMA8 crosses from above to below a SMA13, while the SMA5 crosses from above to below the SMA8, indicates a SELL signal for the short-to-medium term. 翻译 To summarize for SMA trading signals: While comparing SMA50 and SMA200 is the more classical and widely used parameter setting for the simple moving average (SMA) indicator, namely the golden and death cross. The less conventional, however modern and effective short-to-medium term trend indicator settings are the combinations of \\(n=5,8,13\\).

Summary- SMA: The program is now constructed to generate daily trading signals indicates by the simple moving average (SMA). The parameter settings and trading rules of the SMA-generated signals, which the model is currently applying are shown above. Daily Trading signals from the SMA indicators, include tsignal1, tsignal2 and tsignal3 (include tsignal3a and tsignal3b) for all stocks are generated, and the results for TSLA.US is shown below as an illustration. \\(^*:\\) Whether the SMA indicator, or the trading signals tsignal1, tsignal2 and tsignal3 are effective will be further analyzed by the program, and refer to \\(\\S 2.4\\) below for more details. 翻译 Table 4.2: SMA Trading Signals (TSLA.US) Date Adj Close tsignal1 tsignal2 tsignal3 tsignal3a tsignal3b 2024-02-13 184.0 SELL HOLD HOLD HOLD SELL 2024-02-14 188.7 SELL HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-15 200.4 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY 2024-02-16 199.9 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-20 193.8 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-21 194.8 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-22 197.4 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-23 192.0 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD Note: Output 2.3.1.b: Last 8 rows are shown. 1 Includes tsignal1, tsignal2, tsignal3, tsignal3a and tsignal3b. 4.2 Technical Indicator 2: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (Includes tsignal4, tsignal5, and tsignal6) Intro- EMA: Similar to the Simple Moving Average (SMA) which tend to smooth out the price variations and the average prices are rolling by dropping the oldest data point and adding the latest one. An n-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), or the n-day EMA prices refers to the exponential average of the stock prices (the model uses the adjusted close prices) for the past n consecutive trading days. Different from the SMA, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) use the smoothing factor \\(\\beta\\) to assign a weight to each data point, with more recent prices given greater weight because of the exponential decay formula (The weights can be calculated in various ways, such as linear or exponential). Mathematically defined as: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{EMA}_t(P,n)&amp;=\\beta P_{t}+\\beta(1-\\beta)P_{t-1}+\\beta(1-\\beta)^{2}P_{t-2}+... \\\\ &amp;= \\beta P_{t}+(1-\\beta)\\text{EMA}_{t-1} \\end{aligned}\\] where the smoothing coefficient \\(\\beta\\) is usually defined as \\[\\beta=\\frac{2}{n+1} \\in (0;1)\\] The EMA uses the previous value of the EMA (\\(\\text{EMA}_{t-1}\\)) in its calculation. This means the EMA includes all the price data within its current value. The smoothing coefficient ensures that the newest price data has the most impact on the Moving Average and the oldest prices data has only a minimal impact. The program uses the formula shown above to compute the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) values for each stock at various parameter settings, and creates appropriate related visualizations. Following, EMA trading signals will be constructed. 翻译 Table 4.3: EMA Computations (TSLA.US) Symbol Date Adj Close EM5 EMA8 EMA13 EMA20 EMA50 EMA200 Volume TSLA 2024-02-09 193.6 189.6 189.9 193.1 199.2 215.8 218.5 84,476,300 TSLA 2024-02-12 188.1 189.1 189.5 192.4 198.1 214.7 218.2 95,498,600 TSLA 2024-02-13 184.0 187.4 188.3 191.2 196.8 213.5 217.8 86,759,500 TSLA 2024-02-14 188.7 187.8 188.4 190.9 196.0 212.6 217.5 81,203,000 TSLA 2024-02-15 200.4 192.0 191.1 192.2 196.4 212.1 217.4 120,831,800 TSLA 2024-02-16 199.9 194.7 193.0 193.3 196.8 211.6 217.2 111,173,600 TSLA 2024-02-20 193.8 194.4 193.2 193.4 196.5 210.9 217.0 104,545,800 TSLA 2024-02-21 194.8 194.5 193.5 193.6 196.3 210.3 216.7 103,844,000 TSLA 2024-02-22 197.4 195.5 194.4 194.1 196.4 209.8 216.6 92,739,500 TSLA 2024-02-23 192.0 194.3 193.9 193.8 196.0 209.1 216.3 78,670,300 Note: Output 2.3.2.a: Last 10 rows are shown.

As an illustration, above table shows the computed EMA values (shown above) and line charts (shown below) for TSLA.US. 翻译 Trading signal(s) &amp; strategies- EMA: Normally, when the EMA rises and prices dip near or just below the EMA, it signals a buying opportunity. When the EMA falls and prices rally towards or just above the EMA, it signals a selling opportunity. Therefore, when a short-run EMA crosses from below to above a longer-run EMA is an indication to BUY. When a short-run EMA crosses from above to below a longer-run EMA is an indication to SELL. Moving averages are effective in signaling the ‘support and resistance areas’. Since the EMA is generally more sensitive to price movements than the SMA, and is able to identify trends earlier than an SMA would; the EMA values and resulted trading signals become more valuable in understanding near-term price movements and the ‘support and resistance areas’. A rising EMA tends to support the price actions, while a falling EMA tends to provide resistance to price actions. This reinforces the strategy of buying when the price is near the rising EMA and selling when the price is near the falling EMA. 翻译 EMA Trading Signal #1: \\(\\text{close price}&gt;\\text{EMA}(20)\\) (Price relative to EMA) [tsignal4] When the most recent closing price (the model uses the adjusted close prices) is above its EMA20 indicates a BUY signal, and vice versa for a SELL signal. We consider when \\(\\text{close price}&gt;\\text{SMA}(20)\\), the stock is trading at a strength relative to its recent (over a month) price history. EMA Trading Signal #2: \\(\\text{EMA}(50)&gt;\\text{EMA}(200)\\) (Hierarchical Moving Average Alignment) [tsignal5] Above mathematical expression is not completely accurate, where we believe when EMA50 crosses from below to above a 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA200) indicates the stock prices are stable and established an uptrend trend, i.e. a BUY signal, and vice versa. When the EMA50 crosses from above to below a EMA200 indicates a SELL signal. Note, this is the EMA version of the most classical SMA trading strategies, commonly refers to as the ‘golden cross’ and ‘death cross’. EMA Trading Signal #3: \\(\\text{EMA}(8)&gt;\\text{EMA}(13)\\) &amp; \\(\\text{EMA}(5)&gt;\\text{EMA}(8)\\) [tsignal6] Above mathematical expression is not completely accurate either, where we believe when EMA8 crosses from below to above a 13-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA13) indicates the stock prices are in an upward trend for the medium term. If concurrently, the EMA5 crosses from below to above a EMA8, which indicates the stock prices are in an upward trend for the short-to-medium term; a BUY opportunity is signaled. On the contrast, when the EMA8 crosses from above to below an EMA13, while the EMA5 crosses from above to below the EMA8, indicates a SELL signal for the short-to-medium term. Compare to the SMA version, this set of trading signals are more sensitive, as the EMA bears more weight on the more recent price variations, and the newest price data has the most impact. 翻译 To summarize for EMA trading signals: EMA- tsignal4: BUY: \\(\\text{close price}&gt;\\text{EMA}(20)\\), HOLD or SELL: \\(\\text{close price}\\leq \\text{EMA}(20)\\); EMA- tsignal5: BUY: \\(\\text{EMA}(50)\\) cross from below to above \\(\\text{EMA}(200)\\), SELL: \\(\\text{EMA}(50)\\) cross from above to below \\(\\text{EMA}(200)\\); EMA- tsignal6: BUY: \\(\\text{EMA}(8)\\) cross from below to above a \\(\\text{EMA}(13)\\) and \\(\\text{EMA}(5)\\) cross from below to above a \\(\\text{EMA}(8)\\), SELL: \\(\\text{EMA}(8)\\) cross from above to below a \\(\\text{EMA}(13)\\) and \\(\\text{EMA}(5)\\) cross from below to above a \\(\\text{EMA}(8)\\) 翻译     Summary- EMA: The model uses the same set of trading signal rules or indicator parameter settings apply to the SMA when interpreting the EMA. However, the EMA is generally more sensitive to price movements. On one side, it can signal the trends earlier than an SMA would. On the other side, the EMA will likely to exhibit more short-term changes (price fluctuations) than a corresponding SMA. All moving averages, including both the SMA and the EMA; they are not designed to identify the exact bottom and top (of the price levels). By utilizing the moving averages, the model intends to observe the general direction of a trend (up, sideways/congested, down), but the analysts are aware a delay at the entry and exit points may exist from the moving averages. Most importantly, the EMA has a shorter delay than the SMA with the same parameter settings. 翻译 Besides the SMA and the EMA, there are many other commonly used moving averages such as the Weighted Moving Average (WMA), the Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), the Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA), and etc. Most of them tend to smooth the price movements, so the technical indicator/trading signal is less sensitive to the short-term fluctuations. However, per our investment needs in identify intra-day, short-term and longer-term equity investment opportunities, the model will therefore adhere to the simple and exponential moving averages. The program is now constructed to generate daily trading signals indicates by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The parameter settings and trading rules of the EMA-generated signals, which the model is currently applying are shown above. Daily Trading signals from the EMA indicators, include tsignal4, tsignal5 and tsignal6 (include tsignal6a and tsignal6b) for all stocks are generated, and the results for TSLA.US is shown below as an illustration. \\(^*:\\) Whether the EMA indicator, or the trading signals tsignal4, tsignal5 and tsignal6 are effective will be further analyzed by the program, and refer to \\(\\S 2.4\\) below for more details. 翻译 Table 4.4: EMA Trading Signals (TSLA.US) Date Adj Close tsignal4 tsignal5 tsignal6 tsignal6a tsignal6b 2024-02-13 184.0 SELL HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-14 188.7 SELL HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-15 200.4 BUY HOLD HOLD BUY HOLD 2024-02-16 199.9 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-20 193.8 SELL HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-21 194.8 SELL HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD 2024-02-22 197.4 BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY 2024-02-23 192.0 SELL HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD Note: Output 2.3.2.b: Last 8 rows are shown. 1 Includes tsignal4, tsignal5, tsignal6, tsignal6a and tsignal6b. 4.3 Technical Indicator 3: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) 4.4 Technical Indicator 4: Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. An RSI level below 30 generates buy signals while an RSI level above 70 generates sell signals.

Trading volume is an indication for the ‘activeness’ of a financial instrument. Depending on the financial instruments, trading volume can be measured either using the number of stocks traded or number of contracts with changed ownerships. 4.7.2 Price In Progress To put this in practice, if an increase in volume is observed with a steady increase in price, the instrument can be viewed as steady and strong. However, if volume and price are changing in different directions, a reversal might be happened. In terms of trading price, traders often observed the trends based on the charts shape and cross in ways that form shapes - often times with weird names like ‘head and shoulder’, ’ reverse head and sholder’, ‘double top’, ‘golden cross’, etc. A golden cross indicates a long term bull market going forward, whereas the death cross is the exact opposite, indicating a potential long term bear market. Both of these refer to the confirmation of long term trend by the occurance of the overlapping of moving average lines as shown below.
